Calling Extensions SDK enables 3rd party VOIP providers or enterprise calling systems seamlessly integrate their CTI (referred to as call widget) with HubSpot for outbound calling. Call Widget is rendered inside HubSpot UI and a lightweight wrapper around HTML5 postMessage API facilitates cross-origin communication between the widget and HubSpot.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-an-app-in-hubspot) a HubSpot application and [setup a test](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-a-test-account) portal
2. [Integrate](https://github.com/HubSpot/calling-extensions-sdk#integrate-calling-extensions-sdk) the Calling Extensions SDK with your call widget.
3. [Running the Demo Project](https://github.com/hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk#running-the-demo-project) example usage and how to display the project in the CRM.
4. [Test](https://github.com/HubSpot/calling-extensions-sdk#testing-your-app-from-a-local-environment) your app in local environment
5. [Get your app](https://github.com/HubSpot/calling-extensions-sdk#get-your-app-ready-for-production) ready for production
6. [Publish your app](https://github.com/HubSpot/calling-extensions-sdk#publish-application-to-the-hubspot-marketplace) to the HubSpot marketplace.

## Integrate Calling Extensions SDK

### Get the Calling Extensions SDK

Download the SDK using npm or yarn

```shell
npm install -s @hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk
```

### Using the Calling Extensions SDK

The Calling Extensions SDK exposes a simple API for HubSpot and a Soft Phone to exchange messages. The messages are sent through methods exposed by SDK and received through eventHandlers.

#### Create an instance

```js
import CallingExtensions from "@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk";

const options = {
  // Whether to log various inbound/outbound messages to console
  debugMode: true | false,
  // eventHandlers handle inbound messages
  eventHandlers: {
    onReady: () => {
      /* HubSpot is ready to receive messages. */
    },
    onDialNumber: event => {
      /* Dial a number */
    },
    onEngagementCreated: event => {
      /* HubSpot has created an engagement for this call. */
    },
    onVisibilityChanged: event => {
      /* Call widget's visibility is changed. */
    }
  }
};

const extensions = new CallingExtensions(options);
```

#### Sending the messages to HubSpot

:warning: _Wait for the onReady event before sending sending any messages to HubSpot._

## Typical message flow between the call widget and HubSpot

### Initializing the call widget

The following messages are exchanged when a call widget is instantiated.
![Image description](./docs/images/InitializeCallWidgetIFrame.png)

Once the widget iFrame is created, Hubspot send the SYNC message to the widget after iFrame is loaded and repetedly send this message until it receives the SYNC_ACK response from the widget. If the SYNC_ACK response isn't received within 30 seconds, the widget is marked as failed. Note that sending SYNC/SYNC_ACK messages are handled by the framework. Once the widget and host page are synchronized, the frameworks triggers the ready event.

The call widget should wait for the ready event from the framework and send the initialized event to HubSpot. At this point, the messages can be exchanged between the call widget and HubSpot.

### Outbound call

The following messages are exchanged when user initiates a call.
![Image description](./docs/images/OutboundCallSequenceDiagram.png)
Hubspot ensures the call widget is logged in before sending in a dial number event - if the widget is not logged in, an alert is shown in HubSpot's UI.

Here is description of events:

1. **Dial number** - HubSpot sends the dial number event.
2. **Outbound call started** - Widget notifies HubSpot when the call is started.
3. **Create engagement** - HubSpot creates an engagement with minimum information if requested by the widget.
4. **Engagement created** - HubSpot created an engagement.
5. **EngagementId sent to Widget** - HubSpot sends the engagementId to the widget.
6. **Call ended** - Widget notifies when call is ended.
7. **Call completed** - Widget notifies when user is done with the widget user experience.
8. **Update engagement** - Widget fetches the engagment by the engagementId, merges and updates the engagement with additional call details. [Call engagement overview](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/engagements/engagements-overview), [Docs on updating the engagement](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/engagements/update_engagement-patch)

## Running the demo project

#### Starting the demo project

```shell
# install npm build dependencies and start the demo project
# The following commands will automatically start the browser on the demo page.
cd /demo
npm start
```

#### LaunchÂ the demo widget from HubSpot

Open the console in your perfered browser and paste the following:

```js
// Add the following localstorage override for demo widget
localStorage.setItem(
  "LocalSettings:Sales:CallingExtensions",
  '{"name": "Demo widget", "url": "https://localhost:9025/"}'
);
```

Navigate to the a contact/company page in HubSpot and locate the calling icon on the left toolbar, click to open the settings popover.
Once open you'll see a provider dropdown in the top right of the popover, select "Demo Widget" and click "call from browser".

## Testing your app from a local environment

While you're in the process of building your application, you can manually set the iframe URL for your browser by setting a localStorage value. This will allow you to set a localhost URL for local testing.

To set the value, open the developer tools for your browser, and run the following JavaScript command in the developer console:

```js
localStorage.setItem(
  "LocalSettings:Sales:CallingExtensions",
  '{"name": "<your intended widget name>", "url": "<your dev url or prod url>"}'
);
```

The name value will be the title that appears in the header of the calling widget, and the url will be the URL used for the iframe. While this item is set, the name you set will appear as an option for the call provider when you click the call icon, and the calling widget will use the iframe url you set.

## Get your app ready for production

In order to launch the calling extensions iFrame for end users, HubSpot requires the following iFrame parameters.

```js
{
  name: string /* The name of your calling service to display to users. */,
  url: string  /* The URL to your phone/calling UI, built with the Calling Extensions */,
  width: number /* The iFrame's width */,
  height: number /* The iFrame's height */,
  isReady: boolean /* Whether the widget is ready for users (default=true) */
}
```

Using your favorite API tool (postman/etc.), send this payload to our settings API. Please get the APP_ID of your calling widget application and your dev portal's [HUBSPOT_API_KEY](https://app.hubspot.com/l/api-key/)

```shell
# Example payload to add the call widget app settings
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/extensions/calling/APP_ID/settings?hapikey=HUBSPOT_API_KEY' \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"demo widget","url":"https://mywidget.com/widget","height":600,"width":400,"isReady":true}'

# Note that this endpoint also support GET and DELETE
```

The isReady flag indicate whether the widget is ready for production. This flag should be set to false during testing. Note that this flag (or any other field) can be overwritten through localStorage.

```js
/* Override the isReady flag for "Demo widget" */
localStorage.setItem(
  "LocalSettings:Sales:CallingExtensions",
  '{"name": "Demo widget", "isReady": true}'
);
```

## Publish application to the HubSpot marketplace

The final step once your app is setup is to list in the HubSpot marketplace. You can find more details [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/submit-an-application-to-the-marketplace) . You can also choose to not list in the marketplace if this application is for your internal use only.

# FAQs

### App

<details>
 <summary>How is user authentication handled?</summary>
 <p>
    The call widget should handle authentication.
</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Is Calling Extensions hosted on a CDN?</summary>
 <p>
    No. The calling entensions is very small and should be bundled with the call widget.  If bundling the file is not possible, the npm package includes a compiled UMD bundle that can be included into HTML (../node_modules/@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk/dist/main.js).
</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>When an engagement should be created vs updated.</summary>
 <p>
    A user can initiate a call from inside the HubSpot UI and outside of the HubSpot UI (e.g. mobile app/redirected number/etc.)  If a call is initiated from within HubSpot UI, HubSpot will create a call engagement and send the engagement to the call widget.  Once the call finishes, the call widget can update this engagement with additional call details.  If a call is initiated outside of HubSpot UI, the widget should create the call engagement. 
</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary> What scopes are required as a part of the integration?</summary>
 <p>
    Add contacts and timeline scopes. These scopes ensure your application has access to contacts and the ability to create and update call engagements in the CRM.
</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary> Can this functionality be added to an already existing application in the marketplace or do I create a new app? </summary>
 <p>
    If you already have an existing app that serves the calling use case then you can directly add this functionality to your existing app. All customers who already have your app installed with get access to this new functionality without having to install the app again. </p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary> Can I integrate my existing soft phone application in the SDK? </summary>
