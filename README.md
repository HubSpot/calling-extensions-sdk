## Overview

[![calling-extensions-sdk on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk.svg?style=flat-square)](http://npmjs.com/@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk)

The Calling Extensions SDK allows apps to provide a custom calling option to HubSpot users directly from a record in the CRM.

A calling extension consists of three main components:

- The Calling Extensions SDK, a JavaScript SDK that enables communication between your app and HubSpot.
- The calling settings endpoints, which are used to set the calling settings for your app. Each HubSpot account that connects to your app will use these settings.
- The calling iframe, which is where your app appears to HubSpot users and is configured using the calling settings endpoints.
